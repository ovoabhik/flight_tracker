# Flight Tracker

A real-time flight tracking application built with Next.js.

## Quick Start (Mac)

If you have this folder on your computer, simply double-click the **`start.command`** file to run the application. It will automatically open your browser to the correct page.

## For Developers (How to Run Code)

If you are sharing this code with others (e.g., via GitHub), they can run it by following these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository** (or unzip the folder).
2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

## Deploying to the Web (Sharing a Link)

To share a live link that anyone can open on their phone or computer (without installing code), the best way is to deploy to **Vercel**.

1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up/login.
3.  Click "Add New..." -> "Project".
4.  Import your `flight_tracker` repository.
5.  Click "Deploy".

Vercel will give you a unique URL (e.g., `flight-tracker-abhik.vercel.app`) that you can share with anyone.
